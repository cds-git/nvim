# .NET and Angular focused nvim setup

## TODO

* Integrated terminal, maybe toggleterm
* Way to navigate quickly between files, maybe grapple or harpoon
* Maybe install oil for editing system files
* Add keybindings for splitting screen and navigation
* Fix LSP hover to be a rounded box
* Fix lualine to not split in middle for other windows
* Make better integration for trouble
* Fix neotest for dotnet, after it somehow broke
