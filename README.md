# Neovim

Greatest neovim config known to mankind

## TODO:

- Disable or remove debugging, test, and tuis. As it never works properly anyway
- Look into [blink.cmp](https://github.com/saghen/blink.cmp) to replace nvim cmp
- Look into [flash.nvim](https://github.com/folke/flash.nvim) for some movement util
- Look into [noice.nvim](https://github.com/folke/noice.nvim) for improved UI
- Add [rest client](https://github.com/rest-nvim/rest.nvim)
